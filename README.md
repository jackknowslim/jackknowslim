# Hi there! 👋 

I'm Jack Lim, a passionate Blockchain Engineer & Web3 Developer.

🔗 **With over 4 years of experience in the crypto space**, I've contributed to building decentralized applications and protocol infrastructure at leading organizations. My journey spans from working at **OKX** on trading infrastructure to contributing to **Ethereum Foundation** projects, always pushing the boundaries of what's possible in Web3.

🏆 **Hackathon enthusiast and builder**, I've participated in 15+ blockchain hackathons including ETHGlobal, ETHDenver, and Solana hackathons, winning multiple prizes for innovative DeFi protocols, NFT marketplaces, and cross-chain solutions. I believe the best way to learn is by building, and hackathons fuel my passion for rapid prototyping and creative problem-solving.

⚡ **My tech stack includes Solidity, Rust, TypeScript, React, Next.js, Node.js, Hardhat, Foundry, and ethers.js**. I specialize in smart contract development, DApp architecture, and building seamless user experiences that bridge Web2 and Web3. From ERC standards to Layer 2 solutions, I'm always exploring the cutting edge of blockchain technology.

🔐 **Security-first mindset** with expertise in smart contract auditing, testing patterns, and implementing best practices from OpenZeppelin and Consensys. I've conducted security reviews for multiple protocols and contributed to vulnerability disclosure programs, ensuring that user funds and protocol integrity remain paramount.

🌉 **Cross-chain interoperability is my jam**. Whether it's building bridges, implementing LayerZero protocols, or working with Chainlink CCIP, I love solving the challenge of connecting fragmented blockchain ecosystems. My experience spans EVM chains, Solana, Cosmos, and emerging L2 solutions like Optimism and Arbitrum.

🧠 **When I'm not coding, I'm researching** emerging trends in DeFi, MEV, account abstraction, and zero-knowledge proofs. I regularly write technical articles, contribute to open-source projects, and mentor newcomers entering the Web3 space. The future is decentralized, and I'm here to build it!

Let's connect and shape the future of Web3 together! 🚀
